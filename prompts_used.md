# AI and OpenCode Usage Disclosure

This document provides transparency about the use of AI assistance in developing the Selfie Analysis Pipeline project.

## Overview

This project was developed with assistance from OpenCode and ChatGPT as learning and productivity tools. AI was used to accelerate development, explore unfamiliar technologies, and overcome technical challenges, but all architectural decisions and educational objectives were made by the student.

## Prompt Archival Limitations

**Important:** Not all prompts were archived during development. This document provides representative examples and general patterns of AI usage, but is not a complete record of every interaction.

## How AI Was Used

### Learning Acceleration
- Exploring React Native and Expo concepts unfamiliar to the student
- Understanding Docker networking and containerization
- Translating backend data structures to frontend UI components
- Debugging cross-platform mobile development issues

### Technical Problem-Solving
- Resolving React Native text node rendering errors
- Implementing optional chaining for safe data access
- Understanding state management patterns in mobile apps
- Setting up development environments and tooling

### Code Quality and Documentation
- Improving code readability and structure
- Generating academic documentation with proper tone
- Validating architectural decisions against best practices
- Creating clear, maintainable code patterns

## Representative Example Prompts

### Frontend Data Display
*"Fix the frontend so that ALL analysis data returned by the backend is correctly displayed in the UI, without modifying backend logic. Ensure optional rendering, avoid React Native text node errors, and keep UI minimal."*

### React Native Development
*"How do I properly handle camera permissions in React Native with Expo, and what's the best way to display analysis results without causing text node errors in View components?"*

### Docker Configuration
*"Help me set up a Docker Compose configuration that runs a Node.js backend, React admin dashboard, and MongoDB database with proper networking between services."*

## Critical Reflection

### AI as Assistant, Not Author
- AI accelerated development but did not replace understanding
- The main challenge was learning React Native and mobile development from scratch
- Most effort went into debugging, documentation, and validation
- AI output required constant human verification and correction

### Learning Value
- AI helped overcome initial learning curves with unfamiliar technologies
- Enabled focus on educational objectives rather than technical implementation details
- Provided rapid feedback loops for code quality and structure
- Served as a knowledgeable pair programmer for complex concepts

### Limitations Encountered
- AI sometimes suggested production-oriented patterns inappropriate for educational context
- Required careful guidance to maintain project's critical stance on algorithmic bias
- Needed human oversight to ensure all requirements were properly implemented
- Occasionally provided solutions that were too complex for the educational goals

## Academic Integrity Statement

All core architectural decisions, educational objectives, and ethical considerations were determined by the student. AI assistance was used similarly to how one might use office hours, tutoring, or documentation - as a learning aid rather than an author.

The project's critical perspective on algorithmic bias, its educational design choices, and its academic documentation represent the student's original work and understanding.

## Tools Used

- **OpenCode**: Primary development assistant for React Native and frontend issues
- **ChatGPT**: General programming assistance and documentation generation
- **Expo Documentation**: Official reference for mobile development
- **Stack Overflow**: Community-driven problem solving

## Conclusion

AI assistance was valuable for accelerating learning and overcoming technical barriers, but the educational message, architectural decisions, and critical analysis of algorithmic bias remain entirely the work of the student.
