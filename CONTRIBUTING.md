# Contributing to Selfie Analysis Pipeline

This project welcomes contributions that enhance its educational value and demonstrate the ethical implications of algorithmic bias.

## Development Philosophy

- **Educational intent over performance**: Code should be clear and readable, not optimized for production
- **Transparency**: All bias and assumptions should be explicitly documented
- **Critical perspective**: Contributions should reinforce the project's stance on algorithmic ethics

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/bias-demonstration`
3. Make your changes with clear documentation
4. Submit a pull request with educational justification

## Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New educational demonstrations or bias examples
- `fix/` - Bug fixes that don't alter the educational message
- `docs/` - Documentation improvements
- `refactor/` - Code clarity improvements that maintain functionality

## Commit Message Style

Use conventional commits with educational context:

```
feat: add age-based bias demonstration to analysis results
fix: resolve React Native text rendering errors
docs: update README with clearer academic context
refactor: simplify bias calculation for better readability
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Description**: Explain the educational value of your changes
2. **Bias Impact**: Describe how your contribution affects the bias demonstration
3. **Testing**: Ensure all components work in the Docker environment
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation files

## Areas for Contribution

### Educational Enhancements
- New bias demonstration scenarios
- Additional contextual data collection
- Enhanced analytics visualization
- Cross-cultural bias examples

### Technical Improvements
- Code clarity and documentation
- Better error handling for educational purposes
- Improved Docker configuration
- Enhanced mobile app stability

## What Not to Contribute

- Real biometric analysis or face recognition
- Performance optimizations that obscure educational intent
- Features that could be misused for real-world profiling
- Removal of bias demonstration elements

## Academic Review

All contributions should maintain the project's critical stance on algorithmic systems. Changes that appear to validate or legitimize biased profiling will be rejected.
